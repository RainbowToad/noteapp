# <Note Taking APP>

## Description

This is a simple app that provides for taking simple notes and storing them for later recall. This app was created using express.js and allowed me to begin learning about back end development. The front end interface was already created and I was tasked with connecting it with back end javascript. I struggled with this project, but in the end am happy I was able to make it function.

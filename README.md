# <Note Taking APP>

## Description

This is a simple app that provides for taking simple notes and storing them for later recall. This app was created using express.js and allowed me to begin learning about back end development. The front end interface was already created and I was tasked with connecting it with back end javascript. I struggled with this project, but in the end am happy I was able to make it function.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


## Installation

To install this app you can git clone the repository. 
You will then need to navigate to the appropriate folder.
Starting a terminal from there you will run npm i to install express.js. 
You can then launch the app with node server.js
You then navigate to https:localhost:3001 to view and utilize. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
